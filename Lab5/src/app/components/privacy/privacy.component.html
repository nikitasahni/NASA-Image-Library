    <h1>Privacy and Security Policy</h1> 
    <p>The NASA Image Library takes the private nature of your information very seriously. This policy regarding our privacy practices describes how we treat the information we collect when you visit and use our site, services, and/or content. We may share non-personal information with our family companies for purposes such as research and analysis, and to help them provide you with more relevant experiences. When you use the Services, you also consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy; please read it carefully.</p> 
    <h3>What this Privacy Policy covers</h3>
    <p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of information gathered when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy Policy also covers our treatment of any information about you that our partners share with us or that we share with our partners. This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own, control, or manage, including but not limited to any third party websites, services, applications, or businesses (“Third Party Services”). While we try to work only with those Third Party Services that share our respect for your privacy, we don't take responsibility for the content or privacy policies of those Third Party Services. We encourage you to carefully review the privacy policies of all Third Party Services you access. Also: This Privacy Policy doesn’t govern what our users do on their Image collections and we aren't responsible for the information collection and use practices of our individual collections and collectors. One of the great features of NASA Image's webste is customizability, and users have a lot of flexibility in how their collections behave. When you visit a collection in our network, that user may collect more information than we do, and may provide information to third parties that we have no relationship with, including to advertisers.</p>
    <h3>What we collect and how we use it</h3>
    <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account on the Services (an "Account"), we’ll ask you for information such as your email address, name, and password (“Account Information”). We may use Account Information, alone or together with other information, to enhance and improve the Services, such as by personalization. We use your email address to verify your Account and to communicate with you, as described in more detail below.</p>
    <p><strong>Email Communications with Us:</strong> As part of the Services, you may occasionally receive email and other communications from us. Administrative communications relating to your Account (e.g., for purposes of Account recovery or password reset) are considered part of the Services and your Account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving. We also may send you other kinds of emails, which you can opt-out of by using the “Opt-Out” link in the emails themselves. Note that we will never email you to ask for your password or other Account Information; if you receive such an email, please forward it to us.</p>  
    <p><strong>Information Obtained from Third Party Services:</strong> In some cases, we partner with Third Party Services that may provide information about you. Such information could include, for example, your gender, if you have disclosed that information to that third party and made it available for NASA Images to access. To the extent we obtain such information, we may use it to develop new Services or to improve or enhance the Services.</p>
    <p><strong>Information Collected Using Cookies and Web Tags:</strong> Cookies are text files that may be sent to and saved by your web browser when you access a website; your web browser stores these cookies in a way associated with each website you visit, and you can generally see your cookies through your browser settings, depending on what browser you’re using. A web tag is code or a pixel embedded in a web page, or email, that allows NASA Images or a third party to see that you have looked at that page. We use cookies and web tags to enable our servers to recognize your web browser and tell us how and when you use the Services. Our cookies do not, by themselves, contain information that personally identifies you, and we don't combine the general information collected through cookies with other such information to tell us who you are. However, we do use cookies to identify that you have logged in, and that your web browser has accessed the Services, and we may associate that information with your Account if you have one. We may also store unique or near-unique identifiers that we associate with your Account in our cookies. Most web browsers have an option for turning off the cookie feature, which will prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, as well as (depending on the sophistication of your web browser) allowing you to decide on acceptance of each new cookie in a variety of ways. If you disable cookies, you won't be able to log into your Account, and so won’t be able to use the vast majority of our Services; as such, we don't recommend disabling your cookies when using the Services. Note that, unless otherwise disclosed, this Privacy Policy covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of cookies by third parties.</p>
